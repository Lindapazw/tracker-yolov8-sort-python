# YOLO Object Detection with SORT Tracking

This repository contains a Python script for real-time object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and object tracking using SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking). The script processes a video file to detect objects and assign unique IDs to them for tracking.

## Dependencies

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `cv2` (OpenCV): For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- `ultralytics`: For utilizing the YOLO model.
- `short`: For SORT tracking algorithm.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:
